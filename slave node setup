1, establish ssh connection bitween both the master and slave servers
	follow the below link

	https://github.com/salvadihari/ssh-passwd-less-authentication/blob/main/ssh_passwd_less_config


2, install mariadb-server on both the centos 7 servers

	yum install mariadb-server 

3, enable the mariadb-server and start the server 
	systemctl status mariadb

	systemctl enable  mariadb && systemctl start mariadb && systemctl status mariadb

4, install the net tools to enable the port of mysql
	yum install net-tools

5, install firewalld service is not installed in your server
	yum install firewalld
	systemctl unmask firewalld && systemctl enable firewalld && systemctl start firewalld
	systemctl status firewalld
	
6, check if the mysql service is presenr or not 
	firewall-cmd --get-services | grep mysql --color
	
7, add mysql serive permanently to the firewall 

	firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mysql

8, now reload the firewall
	firewall-cmd --reload 
	
9, run below command to know mysql service is there or not in the firewall
	firewall-cmd --list-all
	
10, mysql serive configuraion setup:

	mysql_secure_installation
	
		you need to give the following Y/N 
		
		Enter current password for root (enter for none):  <just enter we don't need anyroot passws>
		Set root password? [Y/n] <Y set your passwd>
		Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] <Y>
		Disallow root login remotely? <Y>
		Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] <Y>
		Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] <y>
		
    
11, Now get mysql schemas with below command
	    mysql -e "show schemas"
	
	if your getting the below error:
		[root@ip-172-31-40-42 centos]# mysql
		ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
	
	Create a file in your root dir called .my.cnf with the below command
		vi .my.cnf
		
		enther the below lines to the file
		
		[client]
		user=root
		password=admin
	
	save and exit 
	
	now restart the mariadb
	
	now try to log in to mysql it should login directly to mysql.
  
12, do the below steps when 21 step complted from the master set-up file

	
13, now create a database with the below command
		mysql -e "create database db1"
		
		now db1 is created we can see with the below commad
		
			mysql -e "show schemas"
		
	now chwck the dumped data from the master with the below command
		ls 
		
		we should see db1.sql backup dump
	
	now impoet hte database with the below	command
		mysql db1 < db1.sql 
	
14, now log in to the mysql with the below commad
		mysql
		
	give thte below commads
		use db1
		
		show tables;
			
	    you should see the tables created in the master server in this slave server

15, give the below commad to verify the table content
			select * from dbtb1;
			
		this commad	should show the table content wich added in master serive
		
		now quit from mariadb with the below commad
			
			quit
			
16, now we need to complete mysql slave configuraion and add the below lines to the file

	vi /etc/my.cnf
	 
	
	server-id=2
	replicate-wild-do-table=db1.%

			here db1 contnent will replicated from master as we specified in file with db1.%
			
	save the file and restart the mariadb with the below commad

			systemctl restart mariadb
			
17, now in the master database server we need to unlock the tables

18, after unlocking the tables
	we need to tell master server details to salve serive with the below commad
	
		mysql
		change master to
    -> master_host='172.31.40.42',
    -> master_user='root',
    -> master_password='admin',
    ->  master_log_file='mysql-bin.000001',
    -> master_log_pos=245;
		
		we should get the below conformation
		Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
	now give the below command
	
			start slave
			
				it should gove the below configuraion with out any issues
				Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
		
	now give the below command to check the status of the slave db server
	
			show slave status
					
					above command will print unredable output
			
			show slave status\G;
			
					this above command will print reble output
